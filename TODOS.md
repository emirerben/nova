# Nova — Deferred Work

## P1 — Required before GTM campaigns go live

### UTM Capture
**What:** Add utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign columns to `waitlist_signups` table.
**Why:** Organic TikTok (and any future channel) sends tagged URLs — without server-side capture, attribution is lost even if analytics JS fires.
**How:** New Alembic migration adds 3 nullable VARCHAR columns; `POST /api/waitlist` reads them from query params in the request.
**Effort:** S (human: ~1 day / CC: ~5 min)
**Priority:** P1 — add before first TikTok campaign goes live
**Depends on:** Waitlist table must exist (landing page PR must be merged first)

### Resend Confirmation Email
**What:** Send a transactional "You're on the Nova waitlist" email on successful signup.
**Why:** Without confirmation, ~15% of collected emails will be typos, disposable addresses, or bots — poisoning the list before launch. A clicked confirmation is a real lead signal.
**How:** Add Resend (or Postmark) as dependency; `POST /api/waitlist` dispatches a Celery task to send the email after insert. Email: subject "You're on the Nova waitlist", body: value prop + "we'll reach out when your spot opens."
**Effort:** S (human: ~1 day / CC: ~10 min)
**Priority:** P1 — add before GTM campaigns drive significant traffic
**Depends on:** Resend API key (free tier: 3k emails/month)
