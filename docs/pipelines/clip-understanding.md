# Shared clip understanding record (KRI-127)

One open-vocabulary record per clip, written by the analyzer and read by every
agent. It exists so a new kind of creator request ("name the dish", "label each
city", "the pub videos") never needs a new field, enum or keyword list.

## Shape

`app/schemas/clip_understanding.py::ClipUnderstanding` — `subject`, `summary`,
`setting`, `activity`, `people{count, speaks_to_camera, note}`,
`speech{has_speech, to_camera, transcript}`, `on_screen_text`, `brands`,
`content_type`, `audio_type`, `notable_moments`. Everything is free text or a
plain flag. It is AI-written evidence and is never on-screen copy by itself.

## One writer, one reader

- **Writer:** `understanding_payload(meta, best_moments=...)` in
  `app/services/clip_understanding.py`. `autoplace._analyze_video` persists it
  under `PlanItemAsset.analysis["understanding"]` (plus a correctly named
  top-level `transcript`; the legacy `on_screen_text` key still holds the spoken
  transcript for videos and is kept for back-compat).
- **Reader:** `clip_record(analysis, kind=...)`. It never raises and projects
  new analyses, legacy video analyses (v<=7) and image analyses into the same
  record. The chat agent (`creator_sessions._chat_evidence`) and the edit
  planner (`edit_proposal_build` → `EditProposalMedia`) read clips only through
  it. Do not read `analysis[...]` keys directly in a new consumer.

Text fields are defanged (control characters, role markers, code fences) because
transcripts are third-party text that ends up in agent prompts.

## Invariants

- **`ClipMeta` field names.** Older modules read optional attributes off
  `ClipMeta` with `getattr(meta, "<name>", default)` for names it never had
  (`summary`, `brands`, `composition_note`, `content_type`, `audio_type`). A new
  field with one of those names silently switches that code path on with no
  flag. Such fields are named `clip_*` on `ClipMeta`. Guard:
  `tests/pipeline/test_clip_meta_dormant_readers.py`.
- **The record does not feed `matcher_clip_metas`.** Its `detected_subject`
  drives the on-screen sport-label keyword matcher and the music matcher prompt.
  Replaying the real KRI-126 clips showed free-text `activity` gains a wrong
  label and loses a correct one. Guard:
  `tests/pipeline/test_guided_story_clip_understanding.py`.
- **Versioning.** `ANALYSIS_VERSION = 8` is video-only; photos stay fresh at 6
  (`_MIN_FRESH_ANALYSIS_VERSION_BY_KIND`). Re-analysis is lazy. `clip_cache`
  invalidates through `CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION` + the analyzer `prompt_version`.
- **parse() threading.** New `ClipMetadataOutput` fields must be threaded
  through `ClipMetadataAgent.parse()` (`TestParseThreading`).

## Fixture

`tests/fixtures/kri126_thirty_clip_guided_story.json` carries a real
`understanding` block per clip, regenerated from the production clips with
`scripts/dev/regen_kri126_fixture.py` (read-only on prod; transcripts and brand
strings are redacted before anything is written).

## Not in this layer yet

Request-to-clip matching, on-demand vision re-query and grounded on-screen
labels (KRI-127 part 2, flag-gated). Known latent gap:
`generative_build._clip_meta_from_cache` drops the `clip_*` fields on the
fast-reburn cache round trip; nothing reads them there today.
