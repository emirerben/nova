# Kria agent runtime v2

Kria runtime v2 turns the existing creation thread, Main Creator Agent, editor,
and render pipeline into one durable creator workflow. It is a domain controller
for Nova editing, not a general assistant and not a second renderer.

## Golden path

```text
user message
  -> append semantic thread event + durable turn
  -> async planner receives a trusted bounded snapshot
  -> deterministic policy validates tools, risk, evidence, and revisions
  -> read/reversible strategy or editor draft OR exact approval
  -> typed receipt
  -> observed assistant response
  -> existing editor commit or Job dispatcher/render/review when approved
```

The model may propose intent. Server code owns authorization, revisions, risk,
idempotency, storage resolution, execution, and completion language. A plan is
never evidence that work happened. Only a settled receipt can support “changed,”
“rendered,” or other completed-action copy.

## State ownership

| Concern | Authority |
|---|---|
| Creator-visible transcript | append-only `CreationThreadEvent` |
| Runtime selection | immutable `CreationThread.runtime_version` |
| One user message lifecycle | `CreatorAgentTurn` |
| Reversible working edit | immutable, revisioned `CreatorEditDraft` |
| Consequential consent | `CreatorAgentApproval` |
| Tool result and side-effect identity | `CreatorAgentExecution` |
| Rendered media | existing `PlanItem` and `Job` |

Runtime-v1 threads keep their existing controller and projections. A thread never
changes runtime owner because a flag changes during its lifetime.

New threads also remain runtime v1 when the field is omitted. During internal
testing only, a client may request `runtime_version: 2` with no inline message
after `KRIA_RUNTIME_V2_ENABLED=true`; its first creator message then goes through
the durable `/turns` endpoint. This explicit opt-in prevents an old web build
from silently entering the new controller during a staggered deploy. Legacy
`/messages` and `/actions` mutations reject v2 threads, so they cannot bypass
the new turn ledger or render-consent boundary.

## Tool contract

`app.kria.registry.KRIA_TOOLS` is the only runtime-v2 tool registry. Each entry
owns its argument/result schema, version, capability, risk, execution mode,
retry policy, failure class, and executor binding. The model manifest and checked
contract snapshot are generated from it.

To add a read-only tool:

1. Define strict Pydantic argument and result models.
2. Add one deterministic executor and one registry entry.
3. Add a whole-turn fixture and expected receipt/semantic response.
4. Run `make verify-kria`.

Reversible draft tools must additionally validate the authoritative draft and
write a new revision atomically. Approval-required tools must never execute from
the planner output; deterministic policy creates a pinned approval first.

After a playable generation exists, the planner uses the existing versioned
Edit Copilot parser against a server-derived snapshot. The snapshot contains
only bounded text, caption, timeline, capability, and opaque target metadata;
storage paths and signed URLs are excluded. `draft.apply_editor_ops` compiles
the portable launch subset into Nova's full-section `EditorCommitRequest`:

- timeline reorder, remove, trim, split, duration, transition, and look;
- text/title content, timing, and parity-verified style fields;
- caption text, replacement, timing, emphasis, and presentation settings;
- music removal and mix changes;
- add unused sources, image duration, and image stacking;
- separately rendered, revision-fenced reviewed speech-cut candidates.

The compiler is non-mutating. Approval consumption calls the existing editor
commit or speech-cut validator while the exact Job is locked, records the new
generation in the accepted execution, commits, and only then publishes. A lost
broker acknowledgement becomes `outcome_unknown`; it is never blindly retried.

## Conversation contract

Every assistant turn has one value class: decision, question, action, progress,
review, or recovery. Repeating the brief is not a value class. Internal planning,
tool selection, retries, and worker callbacks are projected into quiet status or
one generation lifecycle artifact, not conversational bubbles.

Failures use `KriaProblem`: stable code, phase, useful message, retryability,
recovery action, trace ID, current revision, and safe target identities. The
creator sees the problem, what stayed safe, and one next action. Operators can
follow `thread -> turn -> approval/execution -> Job/variant/generation/task`.

Runtime-v2 HTTP reads are bounded. `GET /creation-threads/{id}` returns the
newest page in chronological display order; `after_sequence=N`
returns later events and `before_sequence=N` pages backward. The `/delta` path
remains a compatibility alias, while internal editor refreshes request
`projection=full`. Pending approval cards fetch
`GET /creation-threads/{id}/approvals/{approval_id}` to obtain the current
server fingerprint, revisions, expiry, and consequence copy before deciding.
Framework validation, authentication, rate-limit, and unexpected failures on
these routes use the same `KriaProblem` envelope as runtime failures.

## Creative Brief, router and receipts (KRI-188)

Behind `KRIA_CREATIVE_BRIEF_ENABLED` (or a `KRIA_CREATIVE_BRIEF_USER_IDS`
allowlist entry); off is byte-identical. Code: `app/kria/brief.py` (ledger,
router, request rendering), `app/kria/brief_checks.py` (receipts, reply).

- **Ledger.** `creative_brief_versions` (migration 0111) is append-only, one
  version per turn (`UNIQUE(thread_id, version)`, idempotent per `source_turn_id`).
  Requirements have a server-assigned id (`r<n>`), `kind`, `scope`, `literal`
  (creator-written text only) or `description`, `facts`, and `status`. A later
  requirement with the same `(kind, scope)` supersedes the earlier one. The
  Main Creator (prompt v37) only proposes `brief_updates`; unparseable entries
  are dropped, never fatal. Versions are written by the turn-completion
  transaction under the thread lock, after the revision fence, so a requeued
  turn never persists one.
- **Router.** `route_requirements` is deterministic. `replan` when a new
  requirement is `order`/`select`, a per-clip text requirement arrives and the
  plan has no per-clip text lane, the kinds are mixed, there is no editable
  render, or the message asks to redo it ("do it again based on my prompt").
  Otherwise `editor_ops`. With a render present the Main Creator runs first (it
  extracts the requirements) and the copilot only when the router says
  `editor_ops`. `_validate_draft_plan` rejects an editor-ops-only plan when the
  route is `replan`.
- **Request.** With the flag on, the Main Creator and the clip-intent planner
  read `render_brief_request(brief)`, and the approval dispatch passes it as
  `creator_request` instead of the draft summary.
- **Receipts.** Each draft turn attaches `requirement_receipts`
  (`met | partial | not_possible`, reason, `inferred`) to its `draft_applied`
  event payload. Checks: per-clip text coverage, order basis
  (`ordering_basis` / `ordering_fallback_clip_ids` when present), duration
  within +/-10%, literal text (whole-word, Turkish-aware match). `clip:<id>`
  is checked against that clip only; editor payloads carry no per-clip
  structure, so per-clip text on an editor edit is `partial` ("can't verify"),
  never `not_possible`. A requirement with no checker is `partial`, and that
  neutral "can't verify" never flips the reply to a failure: the model's
  summary is dropped only when a requirement a checker actually judged is not
  met. `KriaObservedTurnResponse.requirement_receipts` is reserved for the
  observed-turn projection; today receipts ride on the `draft_applied` event
  payload and `GET /creation-threads/{id}/brief` returns the current
  brief with the newest receipt per requirement (empty when the flag is off).
- **Cost.** With a render present the flag adds one Main Creator call to
  editor-op turns (the planner extracts requirements before the router runs).
  If that call fails, a plain edit falls back to the legacy copilot-first path
  with no brief update, so a Main Creator outage never blocks a simple edit.
- **Known gaps (deferred).** No retraction ("drop the title") yet; a render
  dispatched later reads the latest brief version, not the version the approved
  draft was checked against; requirements past the 40-live cap are dropped
  silently; `read_creative_brief` scans only the newest 30 assistant events.

## Render consent

Every initial render and rerender requires a separate, expiring approval pinned
to the current draft, manifest, ownership epoch, Job/variant/generation, and
expected revisions. “Make this” may prepare the approval but cannot consume it.
Approval consumption and exact editor/Job commit happen atomically; broker
publication follows the commit through the existing deterministic Job dispatcher
or editor rerender task. Accepted editor executions persist enough dispatch
metadata for the reconciler to publish the same generation after process death.

## Local proof

From a prepared worktree:

```bash
make kria-replay FIXTURE=nermin-matcha-update
make kria-replay FIXTURE=render-approval-required
make kria-replay FIXTURE=ambiguous-render-dispatch
make kria-replay FIXTURE=stale-project-replan
make verify-kria
```

The replay uses no model, storage, broker, or renderer. It proves snapshot,
planner contract, policy, typed tool execution, receipt, and observed semantic
response across happy, approval, ambiguous-dispatch, and stale-state paths. Real
model/media/render validation remains a separate rollout gate. `make verify-kria`
also checks the generated registry/API types, the 240-case structural all-format
corpus, editor reducer, runtime state machine, HTTP envelopes, admin trace, and
migrations. It writes duration/flakiness metadata to
`test-results/kria-verify.json`; feature flags stay off until the live gates pass.
